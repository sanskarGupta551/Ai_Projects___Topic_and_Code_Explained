    "> A `comic` is a `visual form of storytelling` that pairs images with text. They are often presented sequentially in `panels,` which are self-contained frames that tell `one story beat` (for example, one moment, one look, one establishing shot of the scenery). The medium is conducive to `innovation and artistic expression`, allowing comic creators freedom to experiment with the real estate on each page.\n",

    "##### 1. **Story Generation** :- \n",
    "* The first part will focus on generating a good `Story` for the comics. \n",
    "* This step will also include generating the `Title` and a `Summary` based on the Story for our Comic. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2. **Image Generation** :- \n",
    "* The second part will focus on generating Comic `Pages as Images` by building `prompts` upon the Story. \n",
    "* Then we will organize and `save` our Comics as a `PDF`. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3. **GUI App** :- \n",
    "* At last, we will develop a `User Friendlt App` to steamline the entire process of `Ai Comic Generation`. \n",
