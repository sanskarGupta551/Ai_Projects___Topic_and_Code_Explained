    "1. `AutoML` aims to make machine learning more `accessible` to individuals and organizations with limited expertise in data science and machine learning. It’s like a guide that helps you navigate the complex world of machine learning, even if you’re not an expert.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Let’s break down how AutoML works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `Identify the ML problem`: The first step is to `identify` the Machine Learning problem to be solved. This could be classification, regression, forecasting, computer vision, or natural language processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `Specify the source of the labeled training data`: You provide the `data` that AutoML will use to train the Machine Learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `Data Preprocessing`: AutoML `preprocesses` the data to make it suitable for Machine Learning models. This includes handling missing values, converting categorical data to numerical data, and normalizing numerical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `Feature Engineering`: AutoML automatically `extracts` useful `features` from the data. These features are the ingredients that the model uses to make predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. `Model Selection and Hyperparameter Tuning`: AutoML tests different Machine Learning `algorithms` with various settings (`hyperparameters`) to find the Best model. It’s like trying out different recipes to see which one makes the best cake.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. `Training`: AutoML `trains` multiple Machine Learning models on the preprocessed data, using a `variety` of algorithms and hyperparameters. This allows the system to find the model that performs best on the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. `Evaluation`: AutoML `evaluates` the performance of the trained models, and selects the one that performs the best.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. `Deployment`: Once the best model is selected, `AutoML` helps in `deploying` the model for use.\n"

    "* `AutoML` uses sophisticated methods and techniques such as `Genetic Algorithms`, `Bayesian optimization`, and `Reinforcement Learning` to automate these tasks. It’s like having a master chef who not only helps you bake the perfect cake but also cleans up afterwards.\n",
    "\n",
    "* These techniques help `AutoML` to automate the process of `building` Machine Learning models by efficiently searching the solution space, optimizing hyperparameters, and learning from interaction with the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an explanation of these techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1. `Genetic Algorithms`: \n",
    "\n",
    "![Image](https://cdn.educba.com/academy/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/What-is-Genetic-Algorithm.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Genetic algorithms are inspired by the process of `natural selection` and have emerged as a promising technique to enhance `AutoML` systems. \n",
    "\n",
    "* They enable AutoML to efficiently `search` for optimal machine learning `pipelines`. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Genetic algorithms start from a population of `randomly` generated individuals. \n",
    "\n",
    "* The fitness of every individual in the population is then evaluated. \n",
    "\n",
    "* The better `fitted` individuals are `stochastically` selected from the current population, and each individual’s genome is modified (recombined and possibly randomly mutated) to form a new generation. \n",
    "\n",
    "* This process repeats until either the `maximum` number of `generations` has been reached or a `satisfying fitness` level has been achieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2. `Bayesian Optimization`: \n",
    "\n",
    "![Image](https://sigopt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-03-at-12.01.29-PM-e1607025956885-768x401.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Bayesian Optimization (BO) is designed as a `Global Optimization` strategy for expensive black-box functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "* BO first estimates the `shape` of the target `loss` landscape with a surrogate model and then suggests the configuration to be evaluated in the next iteration. \n",
    "\n",
    "* By `trading` off `exploitation` and `exploration` based on the surrogate model, it is well known for its sample `efficiency`.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3. `Reinforcement Learning`: \n",
    "\n",
    "![Image](https://www.automl.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/AutoRL_survey_fig_2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Reinforcement Learning (RL) provides exciting new challenges for `AutoML` that can be solved both with dynamic and static tuning methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "* RL agents learn optimal decision-making strategy through `trial` and `error`, taking an action in its `environment`, and then receiving a `reward`. \n",
    "\n",
    "* If these challenges are carefully considered, the resulting `AutoRL` methods can greatly improve `performance` and `robustness` of the RL `agents`.\n"
